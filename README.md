# hassio-addon-LEGO-garage-demo
Work in progress.

Trying to create a Hass.io addon that will allow me to execute a Python script that will be able to:
  - import the RPi.GPIO - to call the Raspberry Pi 3 GPIO pins, so i can control motor with PWM
  - import the paho.mqtt - to be able to use the pub/sub functionality of MQTT
